    "## 3 - Multi-Objective Robust Optimization (MORO) ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Concluding from the previous notebook \"2 - Comparison\", we identified that any policy will help in reducing the \"expected number of deaths\", the \"expected annual damage\" and the \"total variance of location-specific costs\". Because every policy will decrease these variables, it is our task to find the most favourable and acceptable policy for the involved actors, regarding their interests and preferences. And that is where Many Objective Robust Optimization (MORO) comes in. MORO is a form of robust decision making that takes robustness into account in the search phase directly (Bartholomew & Kwakkel, 2020), by optimizing over robustness metrics rather than over the KPI's themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen in the report, the aim of this analysis is to find a policy measure for Rijkswaterstaat that find is both robust and accepted by the different political parties. By using MORO, the robustness aspect can at least be achieved. And by taking into account the variance over locations, and by taking into account the most vulnerable locations of Doesburg and Zutphen when choosing a policy, the acceptability part is aimed to be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "MORO optimizes over the robustness-values generated by the self-defined KPIs of a policy. These robustness-values are said to be minimized or maximized in order to find an optimal policy within the space we limit by constraints and our definition of robustness. "

    "In an ideal situation, policy would be effective in any scenario. With a robustness function we can calculate the robustness of a policy over a set of scenarios, i.e. how well they would perform in many different uncertain futures. In this case, signal-to-noise is chosen as a robustness metric, the reasoning for which can be found in chapter 2. As all the KPI's considered are to be minimized, a robust policy can be defined as one where the mean (=signal) is low, as well as the standard deviation (=noise). \n",

Let's say we want to calculate the robustness over 3 variables we would like to aggregate with 5 scenarios. The input will be an array with 3 arrays of 5 items. First we sum over the 3 arrays, resulting in a one-dimensional array with the 5 summed values. Then, we calculate the mean and the std of this array and multiply them with each other. This value is going to be minimized by the MORO-algoritm.\n",

    "Let's now define the constraints. Whereas previously (notebook '2 - Comparison'), total policy costs were aggregated, this forms a problem for MORO, as the RfR costs are the same per policy (there is no standard deviation when the whole array has the same value) and therefore the signal to noise value will always be zero. Therefore, we chose to add RfR costs as a constraint, and to consider the remaining policy costs (= Dike Investment Costs + Evacuation costs) separately, as they *do* have different values per policy. This simulataneously reflects many actors preferring dyke heightening over Room for the River, which will now be incorporated due to this constraint.\n",

On the other hand, the table above that shows the robustness values for the 'random policy' run gives a rough insight in the produced values. Based on these values, epsilon values have been chosen that are not too small to not make any difference, but not too large to not be able to trade off between policies that have significantly different results.

However, we assume that the epsilon-progress is the most important one and that the small ranges of hypervolume are not that big of a problem. Therefore, we can conclude the algorithm converged.  "
