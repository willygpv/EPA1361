    "# Policy exploration #\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the exploration of the possible set of policy alternatives. Given the multi-actor decsion-making arena for water management, it is important to consider what possible preferred policy options could entail for other actors. Hence, exploring the policy options space could profide insights into multiple viable - but general - policy options. They are general in the sense that not one specific objective is centered in the search for a policy, and hence it is as objective as possible to find an effective policy. The latter assumes that all actors agree that minimizing deaths and damage costs is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "The found policy options originating in the policy space are compared to the base case results. In so doing, we assess whether any policy will improve the current situation and if a 'group' of policies may be found which have a common characteristic that seems to result in particulary preferred outcomes. For instance, policies that use RfR and dike heightening combined may be very effective in reducing the deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, guiding insights and next steps in the analysis are discussed."
